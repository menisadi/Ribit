# Inflation-Linked Investment Calculator

This is a simple website that calculates the total amount of money on an investment with a fixed interest rate linked to the consumer price index (CPI). It takes into account the initial investment amount, time period, interest rate, and CPI values to provide the projected total amount at the end of the period.

## How to Use

1. Enter the initial investment amount in NIS.
2. Specify the time period in years.
3. Enter the fixed interest rate as a percentage.
4. Provide the initial CPI value and the current CPI value.
5. Click the "Calculate" button to determine the projected total amount adjusted for inflation.

Feel free to modify and use the code according to your needs.

## TODO
- [ ] Add mouse-hover information.
- [ ] Add link to CPI data
- [ ] Change "revenue" to a more fitting term
